This Visual Studio project utilizes Windows Native WIFI API to generate a list 
of available wireless networks, enumerating all available access points, their
MAC addresses, RSSI and Signal Strength.

Supports version of Windows above Windows XP SP2 and should be independent of
WLAN drivers, so long as the Windows Network Stack is utilized.

This project uses the Native Wifi Managed Wrapper found
